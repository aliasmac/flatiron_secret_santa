# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# ali = User.create(name: "Ali", email: "Makdaa1@gmail.com")
# cam = User.create(name: "Cam", email: "cam@gmail.com")
# dan = User.create(name: "Dan", email: "dan@gmail.com")
# bobby = User.create(name: "Bobby", email: "bobby@gmail.com")
